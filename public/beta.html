<!-- This document serves the exclusive purpose of redirecting to the /beta/beta.html page because -->
<!-- previously, navigating to clickercookie.github.io/beta would result in a 404. -->
<!-- Ideally, I would like to have clickercookie.github.io/beta be the primary page used for accessing the beta -->
<!-- version, but I believe this requires something like jekyll-redirect-from, which I don't know how to use -->
<!-- and have no real intention of learning for the foreseeable future. If I ever do learn how it works, -->
<!-- this page will be removed and that will be used instead. -->
